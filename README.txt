Lab2 Scheduling:

1) Please use "cd" command
to get into the folder called src.
command: cd src

2) Then, compile the Scheduling Class
command: javac Scheduling.java

3) After the source files have been compiled, now we can supply the main method in Scheduling class with file name (type the file path after Scheduling):

command: java Scheduling [the relative or absolute path of your file]
         java Scheduling --verbose <input-filename>

For example, java Scheduling input-1.txt (which is in the file of src)
The result will be printed to console (terminal).

Note also put the 
random-numbers.txt (in the current directory) i.e. in the same folder as where src is.
